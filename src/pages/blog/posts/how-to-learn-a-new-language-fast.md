Learning a new language doesn’t need to be a slow or tedious process.

Although nothing can replace the hard work and effort it requires, you can absolutely speed up the process!

Follow these 18 tips on how to learn a new language fast, and you’ll be on your way to mastering that new language quicker than you ever imagined.

### 1. Set language-learning goals

The first step to learning a new language fast is to set goals for what you want to achieve.

When faced with the idea of learning a new language, most of us feel overwhelmed. There are so many words to learn and so many different ways to study.

Research shows that people who set the right kind of goals are more likely to achieve success. Setting goals narrows your focus so you can stop worrying about the details and get down to business.

Use these guidelines to get the most from your goals:

- **Set short-term goals.** It’s good to have an ultimate goal—the thing you eventually hope to achieve. But long-term goals are too overwhelming to motivate you on an everyday basis. Break down your ultimate goal into smaller bits, and set smaller goals for each week or month.
- **Challenge yourself (but not too much).** Goals work best when they make you push yourself. If they’re too daunting, they can actually discourage you.
- **Focus on specific, tangible outcomes.** Set detailed goals, and focus on what you plan to learn rather than how much time you plan to study. An example of a good goal might be, “This week I’m going to learn 30 Spanish vocabulary words related to shopping.”
- **Write down your goals.** Writing down goals helps you commit to them. Post your goals in a prominent place, like your bathroom mirror or the home screen of your smartphone.

### 2. Learn the “right” words

Strategize and prioritize your learning by focusing on what matters.

The exact amount may differ, but for many languages you need between 1000 to 3000 words to be conversational. So why waste time trying to learn more words, especially at the very beginning?

Identify what words, phrases and expressions will get you the most bang for your buck, and work from there. You can start with practical, colloquial topics then work your way up from there.

Also check out these lists of the top 1,000 words in these languages:

- Spanish
- French
- German
- Japanese
  By focusing on learning these words first, you can eliminate wasted time and increase the amount of information you understand very quickly.

### 3. Use flashcards

When learning your words, you’ll learn faster by using the very best study techniques, such as using spaced repetition software (SRS).

For example, one of the best ways to do this is to use flashcards. Flashcards help you focus on individual words and allow you to test yourself, which helps you memorize new information.

When you learn with flashcards, follow these tips to learn fast:

- Try out electronic flashcards. Paper flashcards work just as well as they ever did, but with digital flashcards, you can easily carry large stacks on your smartphone or tablet. You can also take advantage of flashcards that other people have created and made public.
- Make sure to guess the meaning of a word before turning over the card. Flashcards work best when you use them to test your memory, so don’t be too quick to flip the cards over. Even if you don’t know a word, make a guess.
- Learn the translations first, then learn to produce the new words. Start by looking at the side of the flashcard with a foreign word on it, and memorize what the English translation is. Later, turn the cards over and use them to practice producing the foreign words when you see their English equivalents.
  Practice makes perfect, but effective practice makes perfect even faster!
