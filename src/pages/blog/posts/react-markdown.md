### A demo of `react-markdown`

`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

ðŸ‘‰ Changes are re-rendered as you type.

### Overview

- Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
- Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `h1`)
- Has a lot of plugins

### Syntax highlighting

!> Here is an example of a plugin to highlight code:
[`rehype-highlight`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-highlight).

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";
import rehypeHighlight from "rehype-highlight";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactMarkdown rehypePlugins={[rehypeHighlight]}>
    {"# Your markdown here"}
  </ReactMarkdown>,
  document.querySelector("#content")
);
```

Pretty neat, eh?

### GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can _also_ use a plugin:
[`remark-gfm`](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.
